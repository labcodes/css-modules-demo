# CSS Modules Demo

## Overview

This React project demonstrates the integration of CSS Modules for component styling and incorporates `react-confetti` for interactive UI effects. The main feature of this application is a button that, when clicked, changes the background color of the page and triggers a confetti animation, creating a visually engaging user experience.

## Key Features

- **React with CSS Modules**: The application showcases the use of CSS Modules for styling React components. This approach modularizes CSS by allowing styles to be defined in separate files and imported as JavaScript objects, ensuring style encapsulation and reducing the risk of style conflicts.
- **Interactive UI with Confetti Effect**: Utilizing `react-confetti` version 6.1.0, the application creates a confetti explosion effect when the button is clicked, enhancing the interactivity of the UI.

## Technologies Used

- React
- CSS Modules
- react-confetti (version 6.1.0)
